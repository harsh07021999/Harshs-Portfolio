TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that brings static typing to the language. Developed by Microsoft, TypeScript adds features such as static typing, interfaces, and advanced tooling to enhance the development experience. It allows developers to catch errors during development, provides better code navigation, and improves collaboration in larger codebases. TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript, making it compatible with existing JavaScript projects.

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
const message: string = greet("TypeScript");
console.log(message);

```
