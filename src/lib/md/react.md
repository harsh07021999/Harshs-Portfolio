React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of an application. When coupled with TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, React gains additional benefits such as enhanced code quality, better tooling support, and improved collaboration within larger development teams.

```ts
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const HelloWorld: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld />, document.getElementById('root'));

```
