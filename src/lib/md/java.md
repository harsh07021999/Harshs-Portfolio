Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, performance, and security. Developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s, Java has since become one of the most widely used languages, powering a variety of applications, from mobile and web development to enterprise-level systems. Its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy allows Java programs to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it a popular choice for cross-platform development.

```java
public class GreetingApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GreetUser();
    }

    private static void GreetUser() {
        String userName = "John";
        System.out.println("Hello, " + userName + "! Welcome to Java programming.");
    }
}

```
